PCF Gallery is a collection of controls created with the Power Apps Component Framework.

The aim of this site is to list the controls created by the Power Platform community (only controls that can be downloaded are listed).

If you have an idea for a new PCF control, go to our <a target="_blank" href="https://pcfgallery.userecho.com">forum</a>, write there your suggestion and maybe a developer will help you out.

If you created a PCF Control and you would like to be listed inside this site, check the <a target="_blank" href="/submit">Submit a new PCF Control</a> page.

Please contact <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/pcfgallery">@PCFGallery</a> with a direct message if:

- you are the author and you want to add additional links beside your name (Twitter, LinkedIn, Website, ...)
- you are the author of a PCF Control and want to remove it from this site
