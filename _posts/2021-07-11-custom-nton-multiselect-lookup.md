A control for Multselect Lookup based on a custom N:N relationship. It works when there is a custom (intersect) entity between two entities instead of the OOB N:N relationship.
Selecting a record will create a new record inside the intersect entity, Unselect will deactivate the same record.
This control is based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://pcf.gallery/n-to-n-multiselect/">N To N MultiSelect PCF Control</a>.
