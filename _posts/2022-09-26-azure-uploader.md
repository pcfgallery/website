A control to allow the  user to upload files directly to a blob container or any folder under it.
You can easily switch between Azure Storage Accounts, container, folder or use different SAS tokens dynamically.
Proper events will be raised when user selects a file, when the upload is successful or in case of any error, you'll get back the complete error message in the output.
