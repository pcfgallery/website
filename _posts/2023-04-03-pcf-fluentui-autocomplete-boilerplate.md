A control to create a dynamic lookup from any API source. This is a boilerplate only and you will need to edit the API endpoint to a data point of your choosing.  The API  used in this example will need an API key before it will work, but this is designed to give you an example.
The object of the control is to have a dynamic API lookup built on React styled to replicate the out of the box component.
