A control for Power Apps (Model-Driven and Canvas) which checks a postcode (single line text) field to ensure it matches a valid UK postcode.
This is determined by Regex based upon UK government specifications with additions, thus does not require API access.
It has a native Dynamics like error message and conditional field highlighting (error message + red highlighting if incorrect, green if correct).
