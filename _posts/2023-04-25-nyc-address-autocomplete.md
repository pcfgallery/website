A control to suggest addresses within the vicinity of buildings located around New York State, using the open-source GeoSearch API service. 
This control acts as an autocomplete feature and is applied to a Singleline text. Results from the NYC GeoSearch address are displayed, and upon selection of an address, a list of side attributes such as borough, block, and lot can be mapped to a local record.
