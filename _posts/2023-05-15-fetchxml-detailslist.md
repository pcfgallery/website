A control to generate a FluentUI DetailsList for subgrids loaded via a custom FetchXml query and column layout. This extends the query capabilities beyond the standard Model-Driven App subgrid. You need to include an ID Placeholder which is replaced at runtime with the current record id. It is also possible to pass in an id from the current record to be replaced in the same fashion.
