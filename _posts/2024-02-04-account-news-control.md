A control to showcase news articles relevant to the account. It is designed to query any licensed news API (such as Bing news API, world news API, news API).
This control utilizes the Bing News API for its functionality. Based on the API response, extract details such as news title, description, and other relevant information.
Upon clicking the button beneath the image adjacent to the news heading, the control opens the original news article. Alternatively, users can click on the image itself to get redirected to the original article.
