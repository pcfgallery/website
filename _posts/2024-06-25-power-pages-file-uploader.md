A control to allow an external user through Power Pages to upload documents by drag and drop with the option to preview the document before uploading it so that the user can be sure of the document being uploaded.
This PCF also works for model-driven apps so internal users can do the same.
The document repository for this PCF is Azure Blob Storage so first you will have to configure this service if you want to use this PCF.
