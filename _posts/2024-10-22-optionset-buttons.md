A control designed to be associated with a Choice table column, presenting each choice as a button styled with designated colors.

The component automatically calculates and applies the appropriate text color based on the button's background color to maintain readability.

Additional configuration options to support multilingual UI are not required in this case. Choices may be translated using native translation options available in Power Platform.
