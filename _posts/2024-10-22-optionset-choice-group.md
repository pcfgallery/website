A control to present choices defined in a Choice column table in a clear and organized way.

It supports multiple languages, ensuring the text displayed is appropriate for the userâ€™s language settings. This option may be useful if the description associated with the choices is too long for the Power Platform translation mechanism.

Choices are rendered as radio-buttons either horizontally or vertically, and may be displayed inline with the custom text or below it, depending on the design preferences.
