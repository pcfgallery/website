A control that can resize and compress images directly within a Canvas PowerApp. All image processing happens very fast, locally on the device. Features included are:
- Specify the amount of JPG compression you want to apply to captured images
- Specify the maximum pixel dimensions for the long side of the image
- Customize the size and colour of the image capture component button
- Specify whether the camera opens directly when the user selects the image capture button, or whether they should be prompted to choose between uploading from gallery or taking a new photo

By specifying the maximum image dimensions and the amount of JPG compression to apply, images of a more predictable and manageable file size are obtained.
