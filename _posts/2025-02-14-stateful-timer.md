A control that allows users to track time on individual records while preserving the timer state. Each record maintains its own independent timer, ensuring seamless continuity even when switching between records. The control automatically saves and restores the timerâ€™s progress preventing data loss. When stopped, it updates a designated field with the elapsed time, making it an ideal solution for tracking time spent on tasks, cases or other activities.
