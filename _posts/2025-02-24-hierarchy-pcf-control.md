This PowerApps Component Framework (PCF) control is designed to replace the deprecated hierarchy control in Dynamics 365. 🚀

 It offers enhanced functionality and flexibility, allowing users to visualize and interact with hierarchical data in a more dynamic and user-friendly way. 🎯

✨ Universal Compatibility: Works with any entity that has an active hierarchy-type relationship.

🎨 Customizable Display: Displays all fields from the selected card form, enabling users to choose which fields to display.

🔗 Lookup Support: Supports lookup fields, enabling users to click and navigate to related records.

📌 Dynamic Node Cards: Displays multiple columns on node cards, with expand/collapse functionality to show or hide child nodes.

🌳 Side Panel with Tree View: Includes a collapsible side panel with a tree component for easy navigation. Clicking a node in the tree centers it in the main view.

📊 Interactive Hierarchy Chart: The hierarchy chart can be fully expanded, collapsed, and moved around for better visibility.

🔍 Zoom Functionality: Includes zooming options (scroll or dedicated controls) for easier navigation of large hierarchies.
