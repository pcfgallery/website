A control designed to enhance user experience by ensuring that users can only select from a filtered list of options based on specified restrictions. This control dynamically adjusts the available choices in real-time, providing a seamless and intuitive interface for users to interact with complex business rules.
This control is particularly useful in scenarios where you have deprecated a choice value but need to leave it in place for existing records. By using this control, you can prevent users from selecting the deprecated value for future records while still maintaining the integrity of existing data. Additionally, you can use business rules or JavaScript to restrict values based on other data on the form, ensuring that users only see relevant options based on the context of their input.
