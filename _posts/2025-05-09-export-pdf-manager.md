A control to simplify the configuration and control of the "Export to PDF" feature within model-driven apps.
It offers an intuitive interface to enable or disable the export button, adjust PDF generation settings, and control visibility based on user roles or form context.
Ideal for environments that arenâ€™t using Dynamics but still rely on model apps, it removes the need for manual setup or backend tweaks.
Built with Fluent UI 9, it supports theming and localization across multiple languages, providing a seamless and modern experience for app makers.
