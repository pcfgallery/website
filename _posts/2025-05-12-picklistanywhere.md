A control to convert any text or numeric field into a picklist.
Where you have a free form text or numeric field and you want to limit the values that a user can enter. 
Simply add this control to the field on your form, enter the list of allowed values in the form editor and you have an instant picklist.
This is not an alternative to the built in Picklist field, but it does complement it: maybe you have an existing field where you want to limit the values entered by users, but don't want to go down the route of migrating your data to a picklist field with all of the impact that would have on data migration, downstream processing, etc.
